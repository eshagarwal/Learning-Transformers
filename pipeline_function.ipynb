Home to more than 1,500 species of tropical fish, 400 types of hard coral, one-third of the world's soft corals, 134 species of sharks and rays, and more than 30 species of whales and dolphins, it is one of Earth's most complex natural ecosystems. The reef faces multiple threats including climate change, ocean acidification, pollution from agricultural runoff, and coastal development. Scientists estimate that over 50% of the reef's coral cover has been lost since the 1980s, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect this natural wonder for future generations. The reef also generates approximately $6.4 billion annually through tourism and supports over 64,000 jobs in Australia. Indigenous communities have deep cultural connections to the reef, with their traditional knowledge playing a crucial role in understanding and preserving the ecosystem. Recent restoration projects include coral farming, crown-of-thorns starfish control programs, and innovative heat-resistant coral breeding experiments. The reef's health serves as a critical indicator of global ocean health and climate change impacts, making its preservation not just an Australian priority but a global imperative.\"\"\")"
